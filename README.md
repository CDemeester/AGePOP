# AGePOP PBPK models 

As part of the AGePOP consortium, a comprehensive database was developed to include physiological information on age-dependent parameters. These parameters were integrated into PBPK models, enabling simulations for midazolam, alfentanil, and nimodipine. The resulting models are available here.

The base models were sourced from the OSP library, which is available at this link. The new simulations, described in the PK-Sim files, can be found in the AGePOP folder within the files.
